Here you will find a short introduction to the rettij network simulator. After reading this page, you should have an idea about what rettij is capable of and if it fits your purposes.

This website as well as rettij are still WIP, so it will be frequently updated. We hope to open source the rettij source code sometime soon.

The network simulator rettij was developed by the *Forschungsgruppe Rechnernetze und Informationssicherheit* at *Hochschule Bremen*, the City University of Applied Sciences. We needed a network simulator which fit our needs. Many already existing network simulators do a great job at what they aim to do, but we never felt like they were the right tool for our purposes. Therefore, after trying and evaluating various other frameworks, we decided to implement our own network simulation framework:

## FAQ
***What's about the name? How to pronounce it?***<br />
Reading *rettij* backwards reveals its origin: *jitter*, one of the features that rettij can simulate. The German word "Rettich" – in English "radish" – also explains the logo. Therefore, rettij is pronounced like the German word (IPA: [ˈʁɛtɪç]). It is not connected to Java or anything, therefore do not pronounce it *retti-J* or something! :)

***Is there a GUI available?***<br />
No, at least not yet.
